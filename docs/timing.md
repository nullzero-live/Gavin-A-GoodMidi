Incorporating rhythm into a sequence of chords in MIDI requires you to consider both the timing and duration of each chord. Here are the steps and considerations for adding rhythm to your MIDI sequence using Python:

1. **Understand MIDI Timing:**
   MIDI timing is based on ticks and beats per minute (BPM). Most MIDI sequencers work with a concept called 'pulses per quarter note' (PPQN), which defines the resolution of the sequence. For example, if you have 480 ticks per quarter note, you can have a chord start on any of those ticks to create rhythm.

2. **Select a Rhythm Pattern:**
   Decide on a rhythm pattern for your chords. A rhythm pattern could be a simple sequence of quarter notes, or it could be more complex with a combination of half notes, quarter notes, eighth notes, and so on.

3. **Set the Tempo:**
   Determine the BPM for your piece. This will define how fast or slow your rhythm feels.

4. **Map Chords to Rhythm:**
   Assign each chord in your sequence a start time and duration according to the rhythm pattern you've chosen. This means calculating the ticks for the start of each chord and the number of ticks each chord will last.

5. **Programming the Rhythm:**
   In your Python code, use a MIDI library to create a track and add events for each chord. The 'note on' event starts the chord, and the 'note off' event will end it. The time between these events will be your chord's rhythm.

6. **Consider Velocity:**
   Velocity in MIDI terms is the strength with which a note is played. Incorporating different velocities can give your chords a more human feel, adding to the rhythm's expressiveness.

7. **Use Python Libraries:**
   Libraries like `mido` or `python-rtmidi` allow you to create MIDI files and manipulate MIDI events easily. You can set the note, velocity, and timing for each chord programmatically.

Here's an advanced concept example using `mido` to create a simple rhythm pattern for a sequence of chords:

```python
import mido
from mido import MidiFile, MidiTrack, Message

# Define your tempo (BPM) and calculate ticks per beat (assuming 480 PPQN)
tempo = mido.bpm2tempo(120)  # 120 BPM
ticks_per_beat = 480  # Standard high resolution

# Create a new MIDI file and track
mid = MidiFile(ticks_per_beat=ticks_per_beat)
track = MidiTrack()
mid.tracks.append(track)

# Set the tempo
track.append(mido.MetaMessage('set_tempo', tempo=tempo))

# Define a simple rhythm pattern (durations in beats)
rhythm_pattern = [1, 0.5, 0.5, 1]  # Quarter, eighth, eighth, quarter

# Define a sequence of chords (list of note numbers)
chords = [[60, 64, 67], [65, 69, 72], [67, 71, 74], [60, 64, 67]]

# Add chords to the track according to the rhythm pattern
time = 0  # Start time for the first chord
for chord, duration in zip(chords, rhythm_pattern):
    # Add 'note on' for each note in the chord
    for note in chord:
        track.append(Message('note_on', note=note, velocity=64, time=time))
        time = 0  # Subsequent notes in the chord have no delay

    # Calculate the duration in ticks
    ticks = int(duration * ticks_per_beat)
    
    # Add 'note off' for each note in the chord
    for note in chord:
        track.append(Message('note_off', note=note, velocity=64, time=ticks))
        ticks = 0  # Reset ticks after the first note off

# Save the MIDI file
mid.save('chord_sequence_with_rhythm.mid')
```

In this example, the rhythm pattern is defined in terms of beats for simplicity, but depending on your needs, you may need to incorporate more complex rhythm patterns. You will also need to adjust the 'time' parameter in the Messages to account for the ticks between chords and within the chords themselves.

When working with MIDI and rhythm, ensure you're also considering musical context and how the rhythm interacts with other elements in the music. This could involve more complex timing structures, syncopation, or humanization techniques to make the rhythm feel less mechanical.
